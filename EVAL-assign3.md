### Other evaluator comments

Good work.

### Assignment grade: A+

The four test cases used for evaluation can be found in your
repository within the directory `assign3/EVAL`. These test were
rather gentle (other than perhaps the fourth tests, which simply
repeated the test described in the assignment description). We
evaluated submissions for basic functionality (these were not stress
tests).
